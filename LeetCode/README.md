## CLRS Summary on Chapter 11. Hash Tables

Hash table is an effective data structure for implementing dictionaries. 
Although searching for an element in a hash table can take O(N) in the worst case, in practice, hashing performs extremely well. 
The average time required for searching for a hash table is O(1). 

Take advantage of **direct addressing** when we can afford to allocate an array that has one position for every possible key.
