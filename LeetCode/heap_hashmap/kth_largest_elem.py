215. Kth Largest Element in an Array
Medium
https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/

Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Example 1:

Input: [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2
Output: 5

Example 2:

Input: [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6] and k = 4
Output: 4

Note: 
You may assume k is always valid, 1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ array's length.
